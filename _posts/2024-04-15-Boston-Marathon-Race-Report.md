# Race goals

My goals for the race:

A goal: Sub 3:10 (felt within reach)

B goal: Sub 3:13 (qualifier for London Marathon)

very very optimistic goal: Sub 3:07 (qualifier for Osaka women’ marathon)

Even though Boston is a difficult course, given how my training went, I felt that sub 3:10 was possible.

# Race Day

Like many others - It wasn’t the day that I had hoped for.

I had planned to meet up with a few friends from my running group to catch the bus to Hopkinton, but wasn’t sure if we’d successfully meet or not, as I presumed it would be busy with many people. However luckily we were able to meet and David and I were able to get some advice from Albert on the way to Hopkinton. We arrived at the athletes village around 915 or so, and met up with Hannah and Hiro, made a few jokes about Tax day and some bantering, then watched David and Hiro depart for their wave starts (they were in wave 1). It was already quite warm and pleasant on the bus trip and athletes village, which worried us as to what it might feel like while running..

I knew that Hannah (who was starting in the same wave as me, but a different group), was also going for sub 3:10, was being paced by Albert, and I had the option of running with them too. But  I had preferred to “run my own race”, as Boston is a continuously rolling course, and I know that people have different tempos for going up/ down hills, and I didn’t want this to interfere with my rhythm or theirs (I hope that this didn’t upset Albert, but we did end up running together for a bit anyway). I also know that there are a lot of people on the course, and I didn't want the added pressure/ mental load of trying to stick to a particular person the whole time.

My mentality going into the race was to “keep on believing” and to also not overthink the race (what happened at NYC, especially since running “THE Boston Marathon” has been one of my goals since I started running in ~2017, after originally qualifying in 2019, pandemic has meant that I haven’t been able to run until this year). I tried to think of race morning to be more like one of the longer training runs that I had been doing.

My strategy for the race was to run as relaxed as possible until the top of heartbreak, averaging around MP, and then have enough to go for a full send in the last ~10km.

The walk from the athletes village to the start corral was actually quite nice, because I felt like it gave us space, compared to other world majors where you might be stuck in the packed start corral for a long time. I probably got into my start corral about 10-15min before the start.

The beginning of the race was quite packed, but not too bad. I wasn’t too worried about the start, since I knew that I’d be seeded well, as well as the fact that it was a downhill start. I let the first 5km roll by, crossing the first 5km in 22:24 (22:30 is the 5km split for a 3:10 marathon), I was pretty happy with it, and thought to myself “good, let’s keep on clipping away at this pace”. It must have been quite humid and hot already, as others may have mentioned in the race report - the course has minimal sun cover/ shade, and this is what probably affected people the most.

During the first 5-10km, I noticed I had drunk from my hand held more than I had during my training runs, as it was emptier than I thought. I attributed this to the heat of the day, and took it as a good sign that I was hydrating well. I let kilometers 5-10 roll by, I had a few splits where I was high 4:30s (around 4:37 or so), but made sure that I wasn’t bothered by this, as i was on some of the early hills, and I figured that I was still trying to find my rhythm. However, I did notice that my quads were starting to feel a bit heavy, heavier than I would have liked at this point in the race, and started to have thoughts about whether my 3:10 goal would be possible. I continued to “believe”, and tried hard to not throw in the towel yet. On the downhill and flat sections, I was able to get back up to my goal pace (~4:30) and thought to myself “good good” again.

Through 11-15km, despite me trying to pick up the pace in a relaxed way - I noticed my pace was hanging around 4:35-4:40min/km. It was at this point in the race, where I knew that I had run just one too many splits off pace, and given the heat I was feeling - I knew that I didn’t have it in me to pull off any sort of “marathon magic”, especially with the hills to come. I knew that today wouldn’t be the day for sub 3:10. My goal was then to just try to run as consistently as possible - not letting my splits slide too much, and to soak in the Boston Marathon, after all I was finally “here” after a 5 year journey.

With more rolling, I crossed halfway in 98:20, I quickly shifted my focus onto running a sub 3:20 to beat my NYC time and run a slightly positive split. By this time, I had also finished the water in my handheld, so decided to “toss it”, in the hopes that it would give me a “fresh kick”. Although I was using a handheld, I was also grabbing water from the water stations to splash my head/ neck and back with water to cool myself down. I also found someone handing out cups of ice along the way, so I grabbed one and put it down the back of my singlet as well.

By this time, between (20-25km) I was running around 5:00min/km and as the heat built up, and with the approaching of the Newton hills, my goal then became to go for a 3:30 finish - and to go for a BQ at Boston. I let the Newton hills pass by, and I wasn’t really bothered by them, after all my focus was now on enjoying the race! Although I did think about how I would be running/suffering the hills, had I been running my target pace. Given my slow-down in this section, I was expecting that Albert and Hannah had already passed me. However, while I was in the section between the third and heartbreak hill, Albert had caught up to me, and he had told me that he had lost Hannah, and an update that David had finished in 2:34 ! I tried to stick with Albert up the hill, but ultimately 2/3 of the way up, I let him go ahead. As I climbed up the hill, I could see Albert’s back, and tried to keep his back in my sight as I kept going.

I let the part after the top of heartbreak to ~38km be a blur. And before I knew it, I was passing by Kenmore and Fenway Park, and the iconic Citgo sign. By this time, I had stopped looking at each split on my watch. I had heard someone yell “sara”, but wasn’t sure if it was directed at me or not, since “sara” was a common name. I later learned this to be Ellen! The roaring screams of going by the citgo sign, was probably on par in the NYC marathon, where you get off Queensborough bridge, and turn onto 5th avenue. It was unreal. As much as I had wanted to enjoy this section more, I also knew what was ahead, the tunnel and the “right on hereford, left on boylston”, and I was focused on getting to there.

At New York, and CIM, I had remembered the last stretch to be a struggle, I had “given up” and been disappointed in how I had performed. However, running in Boston, my mentality completely shifted, I was no longer thinking about my time, but ran thinking about my journey to Boston, and how happy the Sara from 5-7 years ago would be about finally running “the boston marathon”.  As I took the “right on hereford, left on boylston”, I took my sunglasses off and put them on my hat, and just ran with a smile the entire way. I can tell you with 1000% confidence that I soaked in everything there, and enjoyed every bit of it.
